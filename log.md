### Day 8: September 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS typeof operator
        {} JS Arrow Function

    Built:
        {} Figured out the design for the Notification Page Challenge by frontend mentor

### Day 9: September 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
        Learned:
        {} JS Arrow Function
        {} How this keyword works differently inside of the arrow function

    Built:
        {} Practiced JS Arrow Function

**Thoughts**: The main reason to use the JS arrow function is because of how this keyword works differently inside of it.
In a regular function, this keyword refers to the object that calls the function.
But in the arrow function, this keyword always refers to the object that defines the arrow function.

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned: 
        {} Practiced JS Arrow functionality through the project

    Built:
        {} Added functionality to the Notification Page Challenge
        {} Completed the project

**Thoughts**: I thought that I could learn to create read & unread functionality through this project and learn some advanced JS concepts, but this project wasn't that challenging. So, I would be taking on some more challenging projects to keep working on my JS.

### Day 12: September 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
    Learned:
        {} Class Inheritance 
        {} Class getters and setters

    Built:
        {} Practiced JS class Syntax

**Thoughts**: Class is a blueprint to create an object, it defines all the different properties and methods that an object can have but it doesn't give any information. The object is the specific version of the class with all the information filled in, such as different values and methods.

### Day 13: September 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  
    Learned:
        {} JS Class Static method
        {} JS Class Inheritance & Extends

    Built:
        {} Practiced JS class getters and setters method

**Thoughts**: JS Classes have getters and setters that allow you to do something special with the value before returning them or setting them. Getters & setters are used to define methods on a class, which are then used as if they were properties.

### Day 14: September 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} Polymorphism in JS class
        {} Learned the use cases of JS class
        {} Completed learning JS class

    Built:
        {} Practiced JS class method by building an interactive element

**Thoughts**: 
    Class is a blueprint to create an object. It defines all the different properties & methods that an object can have but it doesn't give any data or information. The object is the specific version of the class with all the information filled in, such as different values and methods. 

    Class getters & setters are used to define methods on a class, which are then used if the ate properties. Essentially, they look like properties but they are methods of that class. 

    The Extend Keyword allow you to achieve the concept of inheritance in JS class. It's used when you have a generic class and you want to create a new child class of that generic one while maintaining its features and behaviour but with extra controls.

### Day 15: September 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS Modules
        {} Difference between modules & standard scripts
        {} JS import & export
        {} Renaming import & export
        {} Creating a module object
        {} Modules & Classes
    
    Built:
        {} Practiced import & export through importing a JS Class from a module

**Thoughts**: 
    JS Modules allow you to break up your code into separate files. It makes it easier to maintain the codebase. It relies on the import & export statements. 
    Working with multiple modules can create naming conflicts. 
    To solve the naming conflict issues: 
        1) You can rename import & export by assigning a new name to the features
        2) Creating a module object
        3) By aggregating modules
        4) export and import classes

### Day 16: September 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS Dataset web API
        {} Gone through some A11Y documentation on how to make any interactive elements accessible
        {} Revised all of the JS concepts that I learned over the week

**Thoughts**: 
    Now, I am looking for a challenging project to put all of the things that I learned so far about es6 to the test.

### Day 17: October 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS Object Prototype
        {} JS Iterables & Symbol.iterator function
        {} Destructuring Objects
        {} Object Literals
        {} Destructuring Arrays

    Built:
        {} Practised creating custom iterable objects

**Thoughts**:  
    JS Object Prototype:
    You can add properties & methods to Object constructor functions by using the JS Prototype property.

    JS Iterables:
    A JS iterable is an object that has the Symbol.iterator which returns the next() function. The nest() function then returns an object with two properties: value & done.

    Destructuring Objects & Arrays:
    Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that unpacks properties from objects & values from arrays, into distinct variables.

### Day 18: October 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS function default parameters
        {} JS function arguments object
        {} call() & apply() method 
        {} bind() method

**Thoughts**:   
    You can add default values to the parameter in function declarations.

    JS functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. It contains an array of the arguments when the function was called.

    call() & apply() method allows an object to use a method from another object. The difference between them is: the call() method takes arguments separately while the apply() method takes arguments as an array. 

    bind() method lets an object borrow a method from another object.

### Day 19: October 03, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS Closures

**Thoughts**: 
    Couldn't focus that much on studying today. But managed to learn the basics of JS Closures. Need to spend more time learning and understanding the concept 🙌

### Day 20: October 04, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} In-depth explanations on JS Closures
        {} Lexical Scoping
        {} Learned to Create counter using JS Closures

    Built:
        {} Practised JS closures
        {} Created counter using closures

**Thoughts**: 
    Notes: 
        JS Closures are functions that can access values outside of their own curly braces using Lexical scoping. So basically it gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.

### Day 21: October 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
    Learned:
        {} JS Spread Operator
        {} JS Rest Operator
        {} JS Trailing Commas

    Built:
        {} Practised spread and rest operator uses

**Thoughts**:
    Notes:
        JS Spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where arguments are expected. It is mainly used in the variable array where more values are expected. It allows to obtain a list of parameters from an array. It can be used to copy & expanding arrays. It also works with objects.

        JS Rest Operator allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. Only the last parameter of the function can be a rest parameter and there can be only one rest parameter in a function definition.

    Learning resources:
        {} Spread Operator: 
            1) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax 
            2) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-spread-operator/
        {} Rest Operator: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters
        {} Trailing Commas: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas

### Day 22: October 06, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} Revised all of the JS concept that I learned over the last 22 days

    Built:
        {} Started the crowdfunding product page challenge by frontend mentor

**Thoughts**: 
    Right now, I need to build real-life projects to improve what I have learnt and keep advancing my JS skills.
    So, I have started the Crowdfunding Product Page challenge by Frontend Mentor today. 
    I will be working on this project in the upcoming days and also focus on learning JS Promises, Async & Await.
