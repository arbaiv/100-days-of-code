        {} JS Arrow Function
        {} How this keyword works differently inside of the arrow function

    Built:
        {} Practiced JS Arrow Function

**Thoughts**: The main reason to use the JS arrow function is because of how this keyword works differently inside of it.
In a regular function, this keyword refers to the object that calls the function.
But in the arrow function, this keyword always refers to the object that defines the arrow function.

### Day 12: September 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
    Learned:
        {} Class Inheritance 
        {} Class getters and setters

    Built:
        {} Practiced JS class Syntax

**Thoughts**: Class is a blueprint to create an object, it defines all the different properties and methods that an object can have but it doesn't give any information. The object is the specific version of the class with all the information filled in, such as different values and methods.

### Day 13: September 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  
    Learned:
        {} JS Class Static method
        {} JS Class Inheritance & Extends

    Built:
        {} Practiced JS class getters and setters method

**Thoughts**: JS Classes have getters and setters that allow you to do something special with the value before returning them or setting them. Getters & setters are used to define methods on a class, which are then used as if they were properties.

### Day 14: September 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} Polymorphism in JS class
        {} Learned the use cases of JS class
        {} Completed learning JS class

    Built:
        {} Practiced JS class method by building an interactive element

**Thoughts**: 
    Class is a blueprint to create an object. It defines all the different properties & methods that an object can have but it doesn't give any data or information. The object is the specific version of the class with all the information filled in, such as different values and methods. 

    Class getters & setters are used to define methods on a class, which are then used if the ate properties. Essentially, they look like properties but they are methods of that class. 

    The Extend Keyword allow you to achieve the concept of inheritance in JS class. It's used when you have a generic class and you want to create a new child class of that generic one while maintaining its features and behaviour but with extra controls.

### Day 15: September 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS Modules
        {} Difference between modules & standard scripts
        {} JS import & export
        {} Renaming import & export
        {} Creating a module object
        {} Modules & Classes
    
    Built:
        {} Practiced import & export through importing a JS Class from a module

**Thoughts**: 
    JS Modules allow you to break up your code into separate files. It makes it easier to maintain the codebase. It relies on the import & export statements. 
    Working with multiple modules can create naming conflicts. 
    To solve the naming conflict issues: 
        1) You can rename import & export by assigning a new name to the features
        2) Creating a module object
        3) By aggregating modules
        4) export and import classes

### Day 16: September 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS Dataset web API
        {} Gone through some A11Y documentation on how to make any interactive elements accessible
        {} Revised all of the JS concepts that I learned over the week

**Thoughts**: 
    Now, I am looking for a challenging project to put all of the things that I learned so far about es6 to the test.

### Day 17: October 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS Object Prototype
        {} JS Iterables & Symbol.iterator function
        {} Destructuring Objects
        {} Object Literals
        {} Destructuring Arrays

    Built:
        {} Practised creating custom iterable objects

**Thoughts**:  
    JS Object Prototype:
    You can add properties & methods to Object constructor functions by using the JS Prototype property.

    JS Iterables:
    A JS iterable is an object that has the Symbol.iterator which returns the next() function. The nest() function then returns an object with two properties: value & done.

    Destructuring Objects & Arrays:
    Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that unpacks properties from objects & values from arrays, into distinct variables.

### Day 18: October 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS function default parameters
        {} JS function arguments object
        {} call() & apply() method 
        {} bind() method

**Thoughts**:   
    You can add default values to the parameter in function declarations.

    JS functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. It contains an array of the arguments when the function was called.

    call() & apply() method allows an object to use a method from another object. The difference between them is: the call() method takes arguments separately while the apply() method takes arguments as an array. 

    bind() method lets an object borrow a method from another object.

### Day 19: October 03, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} JS Closures

**Thoughts**: 
    Couldn't focus that much on studying today. But managed to learn the basics of JS Closures. Need to spend more time learning and understanding the concept 🙌

### Day 20: October 04, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} In-depth explanations on JS Closures
        {} Lexical Scoping
        {} Learned to Create counter using JS Closures

    Built:
        {} Practised JS closures
        {} Created counter using closures

**Thoughts**: 
    Notes: 
        JS Closures are functions that can access values outside of their own curly braces using Lexical scoping. So basically it gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.

### Day 21: October 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
    Learned:
        {} JS Spread Operator
        {} JS Rest Operator
        {} JS Trailing Commas

    Built:
        {} Practised spread and rest operator uses

**Thoughts**:
    Notes:
        JS Spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where arguments are expected. It is mainly used in the variable array where more values are expected. It allows to obtain a list of parameters from an array. It can be used to copy & expanding arrays. It also works with objects.

        JS Rest Operator allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. Only the last parameter of the function can be a rest parameter and there can be only one rest parameter in a function definition.

    Learning resources:
        {} Spread Operator: 
            1) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax 
            2) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-spread-operator/
        {} Rest Operator: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters
        {} Trailing Commas: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas

### Day 22: October 06, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Learned:
        {} Revised all of the JS concept that I learned over the last 22 days

    Built:
        {} Started the crowdfunding product page challenge by frontend mentor

**Thoughts**: 
    Right now, I need to build real-life projects to improve what I have learnt and keep advancing my JS skills.
    So, I have started the Crowdfunding Product Page challenge by Frontend Mentor today.

### Day 25: October 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  
    Built:
        {} Worked on the Crowdfunding Product page 
        {} Added the first article to the page
        {} Fixed some bugs in the mobile navigation

**Thoughts**: 
    The mobile navigation bug was causing because of the position absolute with the transform property. 
    So to remove it, used position static with top/right properties.

### Day 31: October 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Built:
        {} Made the modal according to the design
        {} Made the modal responsive

**Thoughts**:
    Day 30 & 31 posted on social media on the same day.
    Notes:
        On day 30, It took me a lot of time to figure out the a11y dialog plugin. I had issues working with importing using their CDN. Later I found that they had issues with their CDN, which caused errors while importing. So, I imported using the local file instead of CDN and it finally worked. 

        On day 31, I made the modal according to the design and made it responsive. 
        
        Still, there are a lot of work that needs to be done for this project. Next, I have to add components and JS classes to build the interactive sections.

### Day 35: October 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
    For the last 3 days, I have been working on the Crowdfunding Product Page challenge. 
    So, far I have built:
        {} Completed the modal
        {} Added all the functionalities 
        {} Added the validations
        {} Added animations to the interactive elements

**Thoughts**: 
    Now, I have to recheck the code and ensure everything is according to design and concept.
    The one thing I am currently struggling with is creating a button that will save the page in the bookmark. I wasn’t able to find any resources about it.

### Day 48: November 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    Finally, I got the basics of Promises. 

    A promise is an object representing the eventual success or failure of an asynchronous operation. It is like a real-life promise, where you have to make a promise and based on its completion it has results. For success, it's resolved and for failure, it’s rejected. 

**Thoughts**: 
    Still, I have a lot to go through in the documentation. I want to focus more time on learning Promises.

### Day 52: November 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
    For the past few days, I was struggling with the concept of promises in JS. After a week of learning, reading docs, watching videos and practising with the code, I finally managed to learn Promises.

**Thoughts**:   
    Notes:
    A promise is an object representing the eventual success or failure of an asynchronous operation.
    The Promise() constructor is used to create a Promise object. It is primarily used to wrap functions that do not already support promise syntax.
    Syntax:
    new Promise (executor)

    The executor is a function to be executed by the constructor. It receives two functions as parameters: resolve & reject.
    The resolve & reject function is called inside the constructor to set the Promise state to either fulfilled or rejected and also to return value (if the promise is fulfilled/resolved) & error (if the promise failed) to the promise.
    The value then can be accessed by the next subsequent then() method and the error by the catch() method.
    Multiple then() methods can be chained together with each of them returning a value.

    Promise has static methods:
    Promise.resolve(), Promise.reject(), Promise.all(), Promise.race()

    There is a lot more to Promise to completely understand it.
    Next, going to learn Async & Await.

    The async keyword before a function makes it return a promise.
    It enables you to write asynchronous, promise-based behaviour more cleanly.
    The await keyword can only be called inside of the async function, it can be called multiple times.
    The await function basically stops the execution until its promise settles. Once it's done, it then moves on to the next line.
    If the promise resolves, the resolved value will be treated as await's returned value.

    As I have completed learning the asynchronous concepts of JS, next will be learning the Fetch API.

    I took a break from studying for the last few days.
    Breaks are required so that you don't get burned out & fatigued in the long run 🙌

### Day 55: November 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**:   
    Learned the Fetch API & how to make Get & Post requests with it.

**Thoughts**: 
    The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources. It provides a more powerful feature set than XMLHttpRequest.

    The fetch() method takes a parameter which is the Path/URL from where the data is going to be fetched. 
    It returns a promise which is resolved when the response object is received. 
    The response object doesn't contain the data directly instead it contains a representation of the entire HTTP response. 
    So, to extract the data the json() method is used which returns another promise that resolves with the JSON data.

    The returned promise from the Fetch API doesn't reject for HTTP error status. It is always resolved as soon as the server responds with the header. The only time it rejects is on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.

    For Post request, the Fetch API takes a second parameter which contains the init object. This object contains different settings that are used to send Post requests to the server. 

    After learning Fetch, I realised I am not familiar with HTTP Headers. I need to learn more about this next
